# Drink-Finder

# A website dedicated to helping the user decide which type of drink to have.

# Starting with the choice of cocktails or breweries, the user can navigate to the page of their choosing by clicking a photo.

# From there they will either be presented with a random cocktail or they will be able to enter their city and be directed to the nearest brewery!
